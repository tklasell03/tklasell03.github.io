  <h1>My Favorite Cuisine</h1>
  <h2>Surf and Turf</h2>

  <p>I love so many kinds of foods. But I especially love seafood and steak. I love getting it from good restaurants but also making it myself. Here are some images of foods I've made or got at restaurants</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Paella I got in Lisbon</li>
    <li>A New York Strip I made the other day</li>
    <li>A lobster tail I made the other month as they were on sale after valentines day</li>
  </ul>
